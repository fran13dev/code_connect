# Code Connector

A Social Network for Developers.

This is a MERN stack application that includes authentication, user profiles and forum posts.

# Quick Start

# Install server dependencies

npm install

# Install client dependencies

cd client
npm install

# Run both Express & React from root

npm run dev

# Build for production

npm run build

# API Keys:

Rename the key.js file (in the config folder) to keys.js and add the necessary data.

# Security

I have used the npm helmet package to secure my application.
All configuration keys (incl. API keys) have been placed in a gitignore file for security purposes.

# Third-party APIs

I have used the GitHub repository API to enable users to display their GitHub repositories in the application.
